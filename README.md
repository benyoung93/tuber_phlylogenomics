# Tuber Phylogenomics

Target capture sequencing of herbarium Tuber samples (0-100 years old) for phylogenomic placement.  

**tuber_full_analysis.Rmd** - Full pipeline for read cleaning, assembly, gene prediciton, ortholog prediction, and `RAxML`.  
**raxml_trees** - directory with results from all `raxml` analyses (i.e. all SCO, >95%, >90%, >85%).  
**probes** - directory with all the generated probes/baits used for target capture seq.
